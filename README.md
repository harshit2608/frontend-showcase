# Frontend Showcase

Welcome to the **Frontend Showcase** repository! This repository represents a showcase of my frontend project.

This project was scaffolded using a custom **[Next.js Starter Template](https://github.com/harshit2608/nextjs-starter-template)**, providing a well-structured foundation for rapid frontend development.
To generate a new project based on this template, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/harshit2608/nextjs-starter-template
```
